## Setup

Vhosts setup?
What do I want to do?
localhost/ is probably simplist without having others have to edit /etc/hosts file

Set up to look at /build file for the docroot
url: localhost:8080/gitlist

mkdir /public  somewhere
git clone git://github.com/klaussilveira/gitlist.git

## Build

How do I get this to build once everything is complete?
Uses local files and writes to /build folder
Extract tar.gz to /var/www/gitlist
Edit config.ini file
